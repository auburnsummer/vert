VERT
----

VERT is an implementation of https://miniscript.org[MiniScript] for use in Rhythm Doctor levels. It is an experiment to see
how scripting can be used in RD levels.

NOTE: This is in an **experimental** stage. It might never get to a point where I feel that it is useful enough to justify
the resulting custom levels split it would cause. In its current form it doesn't do anything more interesting than RDCode does.

WARNING: Posting any levels that use VERT to the Rhythm Doctor Lounge is a violation of the server rules. 

Goals
-----

In particular, I want to explore the concept of "hub" levels, which contain links to other levels with a cohesive narrative. The
main game, for instance, contains a mix of gameplay levels, cutscene levels, and short scenes within the level select. With
scripting, it may be possible to implement a "level select" _as_ an RD level.

What might such a level need?

* Unlike normal levels, a level select doesn't proceed linearly with time. Instead, it transitions between states based on the
player input. 
* A level select would need to be able to store information about a player's progress.
* A level select would need to able to play other levels, and then go back to the level select.
